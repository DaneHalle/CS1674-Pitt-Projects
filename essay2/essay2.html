<h2>CS1674: Essay 2 </h2>
<b>Due:</b> 4/27/2021, 11:59pm
<br><br>

This assignment is worth 26 points.
<br><br>

There are 17 papers from recent conferences (in the format "LastName CONF Year") posted on the course website, for the last three topics (dates 4/6 to 4/22).
Your task is to:
<ol>
<li>choose 2 of these to read carefully (the entire paper) to answer Part II,</li>
<li>choose 3 (different than the first 2) for which you read the Introduction section (feel free to skim the rest but no need to) to answer Part I
</ol>
You will not be penalized for providing more than the suggested number of sentences.
<br><br>

<u>Part I</u> (6 points):
<br><br>
For each of the 3 papers whose introduction you choose to read, answer the following questions (2 points total per paper):
<ol>
<li>[1 pt] What is this paper trying to accomplish? (Think about what are the current limitations of prior approaches, and why these limitations are important.) (2-3 sentences)</li>
<li>[1 pt] What is the high-level idea of <b>how</b> the paper will accomplish its goal? (1-3 sentences)</li>
</ol>
The high-level answers from the Introduction section are sufficient.
<br><br>

<u>Part II</u> (20 points):
<br><br>
For each of the 2 papers you chose to read in detail, answer the following questions (10 points total per paper):
<ol>
<li>[2 pts] Summarize what this paper aims to do (what gap in science it is trying to address), and what its main contribution is, compared to what prior methods have already accomplished. (2-3 sentences)</li>
<li>[3 pts] Summarize the proposed approach. (3-5 sentences)</li>
<li>[2 pts] Summarize the experimental validation of the approach-- how is the proposed method tested, and what are the major observations and conclusions about its effectiveness? (2-3 sentences)</li>
<li>[1 pt] What is one advantage of the proposed approach, beyond strong performance/accuracy? (1-3 sentences)</li>
<li>[1 pt] What is one disadvantage/weakness/limitation of the approach or experimental validation? (1-3 sentences)</li>
<li>[1 pt] Suggest one possible extension of this approach, i.e. one idea for future work. (1-3 sentences)</li>
</ol>
You do not need to understand the entire mathematical details of the work; high-level descriptions (e.g., no need to provide equations) are sufficient.
